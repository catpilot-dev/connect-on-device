# COD — Connect on Device

A self-hosted web companion for [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Runs directly on your comma device — browse routes, watch dashcam footage, manage plugins, and tune settings from any browser on your local network. No cloud, no account, no internet required.

**Why?** Without a comma PRIME subscription, [connect.comma.ai](https://connect.comma.ai) only retains routes for 7 days. Older routes disappear from the list — you lose all track record for studying past drives. COD reads directly from the device's local storage, so your routes are available as long as they're on disk.

COD also enables data collection workflows not possible with connect.comma.ai — scrub through video frame-by-frame, export high-resolution images with EXIF metadata, and annotate events with notes. We use this to collect speed limit sign training data for YOLO and verify OSM map contributions. Or simply bookmark moments worth remembering — wildlife sightings, scenic views, or road incidents.

For developers, COD provides a signal browser for quick CAN/cereal message inspection using qlog, and lets you download rlog, qcamera, and other segment files to your local machine for offline analysis. Every route includes device metadata — openpilot version, git commit, AGNOS version — so you always know which software produced a given drive. COD can also render the openpilot HUD overlay onto dashcam footage as a live preview or downloadable MP4 with EXIF metadata — useful for reporting issues to comma.ai or sharing driving scenarios.

Integrated into [catpilot](https://github.com/catpilot-dev/catpilot) releases starting from `v0.10.3` — automatically installed on first boot.

## Access

Open `http://<comma_device_ip>:8082` in any browser on your local network.

## Features

- **Route browser** — distance, duration, engagement stats, GPS map, soft-delete, star, and notes
- **Video playback** — stream front/wide/driver cameras, extract frames with EXIF metadata
- **HUD video** — render openpilot's HUD overlay onto dashcam footage as downloadable MP4 or live HLS stream
- **Live dashboard** — real-time telemetry via WebSocket (speed, steering, temperature, engagement)
- **Signal browser** — explore all CAN messages in a route, extract and export signal data
- **Note taking** — add notes to any route for documentation, debugging, or personal reference
- **Plugin management** — enable/disable plugins without SSH
- **Settings** — driving personality, speed limit offsets, experimental mode, SSH keys, and more
- **Model management** — swap driving models, check for updates, download new ones
- **Map tiles** — download/manage offline OSM tiles for mapd
- **Software updates** — check, download, install openpilot updates and switch branches

## Setup

### catpilot users

No setup needed — catpilot installs COD automatically on first boot.

### Upstream openpilot or other forks

[How to connect to your comma device](https://docs.comma.ai/how-to/connect-to-comma/)

```bash
ssh comma@<device_ip>

# Clone and start
cd /data
git clone https://github.com/catpilot-dev/connect.git connect_on_device
cd connect_on_device && bash setup_service.sh
```

### Local development

```bash
# Backend
python server.py --data-dir ~/driving_data/data --port 8082

# Frontend (hot reload, proxies API to :8082)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
